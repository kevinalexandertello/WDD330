  <h3>Type coercion</h3>
  <p>Type coercion means that Javascript will read in an automatic way the data and will transform it to a "logic" value
  </p>
  <script>
      '2' * 8
      //coercion will transform the 'string' to a number to perform the task
      2 * 8 = 16
  </script>
  <h3>Arrays</h3>
  <p>Arrays are a collection of values and they could be call by numbers as a lisst startin by 0(being the first value of all list)</p>
  <script>
            var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0, 2];
    //This will output "saab and bmw as a result"
