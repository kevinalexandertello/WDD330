  <h3>NOTES FROM WEEK 10</h3>
  <h4>Form Validation</h4>
  <p>Form validation is when you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and 
      within the constraints set by the application. 
      Validation done in the browser is called <mark>Client-side validation</mark>, while validation done on the server is called <mark>Server-side validation</mark>. </a>
    </p>
    <h4>Main reasons to validate our forms</h4>
    <p>We want to <mark>get the right data, in the right format</mark>. Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We want to <mark>protect our users' data</mark>. Forcing our users to enter secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.</p><br>
    <p>We want to <mark>protect ourselves</mark>. There are many ways that malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application (see Website security).</p>
    <br>
  <h4>Using Fetch API</h4>
    <p>Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for <mark>accesing and manipulating</mark> parts of the HTTP pipeline and also 
        provides a better alternative that can be easily used by other technologies such as Service Workers</p>
    <br>
    <p>Files can be uploaded using an HTML <input type="file" /> input element, FormData() and fetch().</p>
    <br>
    <p>An accurate check for a successful fetch() would include checking that the promise resolved, then checking that the Response.ok property has a value of true.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A basic fetch request:</p>
    <br>
    <p>fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')</p>
        <br>
        <p>.then(response => response.json())</p>
        <br>
        <p>.then(data => console.log(data));      
    </p>
