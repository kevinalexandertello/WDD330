  <h3>NOTES FROM WEEK 7</h3>
</head>

   
         
     
    
       
            <h1>Notes from JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition </h1>
            <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
            
            <h3>

                Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves

            </h3>
            <p>
                This is called the Lazy Definition Pattern and is often used when some initialization code is required the first time it’s invoked. This means the initialization can be done the first time it’s called, then the function can be redefined to what you want it to be for every subsequent invocation.

            </p> 
            <p>
                function party() {  <br>
                    console.log('Wow this is amazing!');<br>
                    party = function(){<br>
                    console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>}
                    <br>
                    party.music = 'Classical Jazz'; // set a property of the function<br>
                    <br>
                    party();<br>
                     "Wow this is amazing!"<br>
                    <br>
                    party.music; // function has now been redefined, so the property doesn't exist<br>
                    undefined<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Dealing With A Settled Promise</h3>
            <p>
                Once a promise has been settled, 
                the then() method can be used to deal with
                 the outcome. This method accepts two arguments.
                  The first is a fulfilment function that’s called when the promise 
                  is resolved. Any data returned from the resolve() function will be passed along to
                   this function. The second argument is a rejection function that’s
                    called if the promise is rejected. Similar to the fulfilment
                    function, the rejection function receives any data returned from the reject() function.</p>

      
<h3>
    HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS
</h3>
<p>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both.

    function multiplier(x){ <br>
        return function(y){<br>
            return x*y;<br>
        }<br>
        }<br><br><br>


        tripler = multiplier(3);<br>

tripler(10);<br>
 30<br>
</p>

    <h3>
Promises
    </h3>
        <p>
            It also accepts two functions as arguments: the resolve() function is called if the operation is successful, and the reject() function is called if the operation fails
        </p>
        <p>const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => { <br>
            // initialization code goes here<br>
            if (success) {<br>
                resolve(value);<br>
            } else {<br>
                reject(error);<br>
            }<br>
        });</p>

        <h3>CURRYING</h3>
        <P>
            A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted when the original function was called. A final result is only returned once all the expected arguments have eventually been provided. <br><br>

            function multiplier(x,y) {<br>
                if (y === undefined) {<br>
                    return function(z) {<br>
                    return x * z;<br>
                    }<br>
                } else {<br>
                    return x * y;<br>
                }<br>
                }<br>
        </P>
